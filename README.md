# List of the best screenshot tools 2026 (but of course Sleekshot is the best)

I've always believed that having the right tools can make or break your workflow, especially in fields like software 
development, design, QA, and IT. Screenshots are integral to my daily tasksâ€”whether I'm capturing a bug, sharing a design mockup, 
or documenting a complex process. 
With that in mind, I decided to compile my own top list of screenshot tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux as of 2024. 
These are the tools that I've found to be indispensable in enhancing productivity and collaboration.

1. Lightshot (Windows + MacOS)
2. Sleekshot (Native Windows 10, 11)
3. ShareX (Windows + MacOS)
4. Monosnap (Windows + Mac OS)
5. Snagit (Windows + Mac OS)
6. Greenshot (Windows + Mac OS)
7. Flameshot (Windows + Mac OS + Linux)

Feel free to mention yours favorite
